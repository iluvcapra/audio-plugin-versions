# audio-plugin-versions

Small utility that will scan /Library/Application Support/ subfolders
for audio plugins (VST(3), AU, AAX) and create a .txt file containing
plugin names and versions.


## Usage

Directories are hardcoded so you can run it from any folder where you wish
to store the resulting text file.

## Requirements

Requires python3, but other than that relies on standard library modules.
